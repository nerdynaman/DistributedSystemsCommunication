# Distributed Systems Concepts and Design

### gRPC
- `gRPC` is a high performance, open-source universal RPC framework. It is a language-agnostic, platform-agnostic, extensible way of defining services that allow software components to communicate with each other. It provides a way for clients to call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services.
- In this we use gRPC to implement an Online Shopping Platform

### zeroMQ
- `ZeroMQ` is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. The library's API is designed to resemble that of Berkeley sockets.
- In this we use ZeroMQ to Low-Level Group Messaging Application

### RabbitMQ
- `RabbitMQ` is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, MQ Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.
- In this we built a YouTube-like application with RabbitMQ
